# Linux & AI -- Linux Victoria in collaboration with MLAI Melbourne

Tuesday, August 19th, 2025  
7:00 PM to 9:00 PM AEST

## Details

DeepSeek rattled NVIDIA's stock and reminded many of us just how much you can gain from running an LLM locally—especially for those who still hadn't tried Meta's `llama`.

After hosting a couple of mentoring sessions for those passionate about running AI locally, **Linux Victoria** launched the ***Linux & AI Tuesday Night Chats*** (LAIT Night Chats) in July. What began as an informal initiative has since become a weekly gathering for exploring, discussing, and experimenting at the intersection of Linux and AI.

At this event, **Alexar Pendashteh** on behalf of Linux Victoria, presents their finding of exploring the intersection between Linux & AI, which is mainly about open-weight models and running them locally.

Alexar is a technologist and social entrepreneur who's passionate about enabling local economies and resilient communities by leveraging digital freedoms and technology Commons.

The schedule for the day is developing and will be updated on this page.

6:00 - 6:20 Meet & Greet / Socialising  
6:20 - 6:30 Announcements and AI news  
6:30 - 7:40 Discussion  
8:00 Heading to the pub

Meanwhile, if you haven't tried local AI, we encourage you to download **Jan AI** from https://jan.ai/ and get one of the relatively light models such as Llama3 from the Hub.
