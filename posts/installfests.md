# Install Fests

As many LUVers might be familiar, we have been working on bringing back Install Fests and recently there have been many exciting developments! We have visited a few locations and are planning on to run the first Install Fest in May. Stay Tuned!

Since a big part of Install Fests are about trying out different Linux Distributions and helping install Linux on all types of laptops and computer, we are looking for people with technical knowledge on booting Linux systems via USB. We are also looking for an ideal supplier of USB sticks. If you are keen to help out, reach us at installfests-team@linuxvictoria.org
