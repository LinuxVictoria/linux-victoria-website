### Linux Victoria Becomes a Company
**1st April 2025**  
A great start to April was our monthly meeting held on the first Tuesday. This year the first Tuesday happened to fall on April 1st—Fools Day—hence the title *“Linux Victoria Becomes a Company”*.  
This was our fun way to announce our new developments which are very company-esque.
