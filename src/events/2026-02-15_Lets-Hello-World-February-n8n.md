## About the Event

Let’s Hello World is a simple idea. We pick an open source tool and begin.

Not a deep dive. Not a polished workshop. Just a focused session to install it, try it, and build something small together.

The goal is to get past the hardest step: beginning.


### n8n

n8n is an open source workflow automation tool that lets you connect services, APIs, and scripts into repeatable workflows.

During this session we will:
- Run n8n locally
- Explore the interface
- Build a basic workflow
- Connect to at least one real service

No prior experience required. If you have been meaning to try n8n but have not made the time, this is your chance.

Bring a laptop and curiosity.
