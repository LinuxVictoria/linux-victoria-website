### Thank you to everyone that joined us in Gippsland!

What a special day filled with great conversations about the importance of open source in regional Australia. 

We’d like to give a heartfelt thank you to our incredible speakers and showcasers:

- **Marty from Serversaurus** shared valuable insights on the importance and many benefits of Linux and open source software to business.
    
- **Andrew** joined us online to showcase how to locally use the open source LLM OLlama to code scripts and use for a variety task all on your own machine.
    
- **Kiki** also joined online to share a discussion on exploring how internet governance and open source principles build inclusive digital communities.
    

We also extend our thanks to:

- **Serversaurus**  for their generous sponsorship
    
- **Morwell Innovation Centre**  for hosting us in such a fantastic venue
    
- **Cait from Gippsland Tech School**  for a fascinating tour showcasing the next generation of innovators in our region.

As always, it was wonderful to meet newcomers and reconnect with familiar faces, many attending in person for the first time!

We look forward to welcoming you back next year as we celebrate Linux’s landmark **35th Birthday** 🐧
