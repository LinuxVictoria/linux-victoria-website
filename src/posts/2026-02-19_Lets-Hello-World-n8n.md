What a session! Our first Let's Hello World was a lot of fun and a great learning experience for everyone involved, including me.

More people showed up than expected, which was a wonderful problem to have. A big thank you to Alexar for stepping in to help coordinate the extra attendees and getting us set up across two rooms. And thank you to Melbourne Business School for the amazing venue and the hospitality staff who were so welcoming and accommodating throughout the day.

About two thirds of attendees got n8n running on their own machines, which is a solid result for a first session. The internet access at the venue was a real challenge though, and I am sorry about that. A huge thank you to everyone who shared their hotspot to help others connect. Next time we will absolutely organise internet access in advance.

A special thank you to Angie, who installed n8n on her machine, shared her hotspot and gave out her IP address so that others could connect to her instance. Watching workflows appear in real time as more people joined and started experimenting was genuinely fun. It turned into a really lovely shared experience.

After the session wrapped up, some attendees stayed on to see a Japanese learning app connected to a local LLM running on Janai, which was built during the session. A nice bonus to end the day on.

We are also putting together a set of n8n workflows to share with attendees to try out at their own pace. Keep an eye out for that.

## What We Learned

- **n8n is mostly aimed at businesses.** For the next session we will pick a tool that is more suited to everyday hobby use.
- **Internet access needs to be sorted in advance.** 
- **In-person or online, not both at once.** Hybrid adds complexity. We are thinking of alternating between in-person and online sessions.
- **Print out the steps.** Even for a self-guided session, having something on paper makes a real difference.
- **I forgot to mention in the event notes to bring a laptop.** While people did bring a laptop, a few did not and I realised I should have mentioned it.
- **Extra cables are a must for in-person events.**

## Thank You

To everyone who attended: I could not have asked for a better group. You were patient, curious and genuinely helpful to each other throughout the day. Co-learning with you all was a real treat.

The next Let's Hello World will be announced directly to attendees of previous sessions. If you want to be notified, subscribe to our Luma calendar at [lu.ma/linux-victoria](https://lu.ma/linux-victoria).
