What an incredible return for our Penguin Picnic! After six years, it was truly special to gather once again at Yarra Bank Reserve on January 31st. Our first Penguin Picnic since 2020 exceeded all expectations, bringing together so many regular members alongside wonderful alumni who made the journey back to reconnect with the community.

The atmosphere throughout the day was warm and welcoming, filled with conversations ranging from the latest in open source developments to nostalgic memories of past LUV gatherings. It was heartening to see familiar faces and new ones alike sharing stories, swapping tech tips, and simply enjoying each other's company in the beautiful outdoor setting.

A huge thank you to everyone who brought food and drinks to share! The spread was incredible, with a fantastic selection of options including vegetarian, vegan, and various other dietary choices ensuring everyone could enjoy the feast. Special thanks also to those who volunteered their cars to help fetch additional supplies when needed.

Most importantly, thank you for joining us and making the day so special (especially those that came a long way from regional!). The energy, laughter, and sense of community made this Penguin Picnic one to remember. We're already looking forward to the next one!
