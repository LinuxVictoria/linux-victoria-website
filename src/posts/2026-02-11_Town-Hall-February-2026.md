## Thank You for Joining Us!

Thank you to everyone who attended our February 2026 Town Hall meeting! It was wonderful to see such an engaged community coming together to share knowledge and discuss important topics in the FOSS ecosystem.

Big thanks to [Inspire9](https://inspire9.com?utm-source=linux-victoria) as well for providing the venue where we could meet in person!

## Meeting Highlights

**Tools and Technologies Discussed**

Our community shared some excellent tools and resources:

- Jami - A peer-to-peer chat platform for secure communications
- Ventoy - A handy solution for creating bootable USB drives with multiple ISOs
- Obsidian - A powerful knowledge management tool for sharpening your thinking

**Community Connections**

We explored various tech community groups and their activities:

- MelbPC & PCUG ACT
- endof10.org - A resource for finding Linux support, with discussions about adding more organizations like MelbPC to the directory
- Neighbourhood Houses - Highlighted the important work being done at venues like Burwood Neighbourhood House, which offers programs to revive old computers (though many are facing funding challenges). Learned that they aren't being funded anymore and as a result there aren't as many neighbourhood houses.

**Digital Freedom Initiatives**

The meeting touched on several important movements and organizations:

- Digital Freedom Foundation - Promoting software, hardware, and document freedom
- Document Freedom Day - An initiative we discussed supporting
- "Stop Killing Games" movement - An important discussion about game preservation and digital ownership, with mentions of PAX and related advocacy

**Events and Gatherings**

Community members shared information about upcoming events and platforms:

- WikiCon Australia 2026 - Coming up for Wikipedia enthusiasts
- PAX Aus - Gaming and tech culture convention
- Gather Town - Virtual event platform 

**Creative Tech Culture**

We also touched on the intersection of technology and creative expression, including discussions about zines and music culture within tech communities, as well as Sabby Gallery for creative works.

##### Looking Forward

These monthly Town Hall meetings continue to be valuable spaces for our community to connect, learn, and collaborate. We're grateful for everyone's contributions and look forward to seeing you at our next gathering!
