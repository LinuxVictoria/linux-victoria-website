What a fantastic day at the Linux Collab in Canberra! The install fest was lots of fun and packed with great learnings. We had particularly interesting sessions exploring Ventoy for creating multi-boot USB drives and running Linux on Mac hardware, which sparked some excellent discussions and problem-solving among participants.

The energy and enthusiasm from everyone involved has truly inspired us to run more install fests in the future. Thank you to Dissent Cafe and Bar for hosting us, and to all the community members who came along to share their knowledge and learn together. Looking forward to our next collaboration!
