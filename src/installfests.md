## Join Us at Our Next Install Fest! (and help make more)

Install Fests are back, with a recent event in Canberra held as a fringe of Everything Open 2026 and more gatherings being planned across Melbourne and regional Victoria. 

These events create a relaxed space for people to explore Linux, get help with installations, and connect with others who are interested in open source. Whether you’re completely new or already experienced, Install Fests are a practical, friendly way to learn and share knowledge together.

### What is an Install Fest?

An Install Fest is a community event where:
- Newcomers can try Linux without commitment
- Experienced volunteers help with Linux installations
- You can test different distributions
- Technical questions are answered by the community
- Everyone learns together in a supportive environment
