### Linux Victoria (LUV)

Linux is an operating system that powers many machines in the world. From Android phones to most servers, and even many microwaves, and fridges. When Linux was new, in the 90s, people who were using Linux on their personal computer or at work, would form Linux User Groups. Linux Users of Victoria, is one of those LUGs.

While, we work on delivering events and workshops in person and online, we actively seek ideas for new initatives and opportunities for partnerships. To learn more about current iniatiaves and ways to engage, turn up to the next Town Hall meeting!
